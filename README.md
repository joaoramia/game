An HTML5 Canvas game developed by me, Ben Manson (bmmanson), John Chen (coldshower) and Ani Agajanyan (aganita).

A simple starting point for writing 2d games. See tutorial.md for more information.

Regime Change is a massively multiplayer Real-time strategy game. All players enter into a single world, where they can compete or cooperate with each other. Explore the map to collect money. The player with the most money will be THE BOSS, and will have special powers that will enable him to increase his control over the map!
